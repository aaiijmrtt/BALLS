Balls: Exploring PyGame

The code in this repository presents a different take on the classic Paddle Ball
Game. The aim is to increase your Wealth while making sure you do not run out of
Health. Both go up every time a ball hits the paddle. The length of the paddle
and your Health shrink with time. You may multiply the number of balls by
clicking the mouse or hitting the spacebar: this will increase both the rate at
which the your Wealth increases, as well as the rate at which your Health
decreases.
