#BALLS

Balls: Exploring PyGame

The code in this repository presents a variation of the classic Paddle Ball
game. The aim is to increase your Wealth while making sure you do not run out of
Health. Both change every time a Ball hits the Paddle. The length of the Paddle
and your Health changes with time. You may multiply the number of Balls by
clicking the mouse or hitting the spacebar. This alters the rate at which your
Health and Wealth change. Be warned: finding a balance is tricky.
